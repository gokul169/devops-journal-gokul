# Day 7 - Linux Process & Job Management

## Commands Practiced:

1. sleep 60 &
   - Backgrounded a sleep process.

2. jobs
   - Checked list of background jobs.

3. fg %1
   - Brought background job to foreground.

4. bg %1
   - Resumed a stopped job in background.

5. kill <PID>
   - Killed process using PID (replace <PID> with actual number).

6. nice -n 10 sleep 100 &
   - Started a process with lower priority.

7. ps aux | grep sleep
   - Listed all running sleep processes.

8. renice -n -5 -p <PID>
   - Changed priority of a running process (higher priority).

9. htop
   - Launched interactive process viewer (press `q` to quit).

10. Ctrl + Z
    - Suspended current foreground process.

## Observations:

- Learned the concept of foreground, background, and stopped jobs.
- Understood how to control process priorities using `nice` and `renice`.
- `ps`, `jobs`, and `htop` help monitor and manage system processes effectively.
- Faced errors like "No such job" and learned how jobs expire after completion.
